USER STORIES - Bus Mall Project
Marketing Research Team
The marketing research team is going to be looking for a way to collect data on participants. Find a way to track how many times an image pops up and how many times it's clicked. Then, store that data in an accessible format that the research team can use. Also, they'll need to be able to view the data in a graph format.

Developer
The developer is looking for elements on the page or code that can be modified to fit new images should they be introduced. The code should be setup in a way to allow for edits or changes to be made. Data should also be stored in an array so it can be accessed at any time.

Focus Group Participant
The participant would be looking for easy directions. When they visit the website they want to know what to do and how it's going to happen. A step-by-step guide would be preferable to ensure accurate data is collected.
